# Task 2
Proposal:
- Use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) for tracking tickets.
- Use [Jira API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/intro/#about) to create issues based on ticketing system output.
    e.g.
    - Do not create new issue for obsolete zone or failure message
    - Set priority based on zone or failure message
    - Update priority based on number of occurrences of zone or error message
